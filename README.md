Origin-Destination Visualization using STPLANR

[STPLANR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr.html) is a package that can be used for travel behavior analysis using spatil data. An example of travel behavior is looking at **who** is travelling to where jobs are. This can answer several questions and help plan for public transit, demand and so on. This project looks at origin-destination data of Pennsylvania from 2017, and visualizes the demographics of travellers.

The template uses the Minimal Jekyll theme: more details on this theme can be found [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).
